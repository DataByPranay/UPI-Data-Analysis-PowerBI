📊 UPI Transactions Data Analysis (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data using Microsoft Power BI.
The objective is to convert raw transaction data into a clean, interactive, and insight-driven dashboard that helps understand transaction behavior, trends, and balance movement.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Power BI workflow — from data loading to publishing on Power BI Service.
